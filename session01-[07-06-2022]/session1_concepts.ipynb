    "## I. Notes of file types & programs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python & IDEs 💻\n",
    "\n",
    "A `.py` python file is just a plain text file. _Nothing special!_ The `.py` extension is just a _hint_ to people and computers that this file should be interpreted as a Python program.\n",
    "\n",
    "> If you want the program to actually run though, you must write things that adhere to the Python language grammar & syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bare-bones python\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a Python program in a simple, plain-text editor like Notepad, e.g. `myfile.py`\n",
    "2. In a \"terminal\" (mac/linux) or \"command prompt\" (Windows) where Python is installed, you can run a python program by typing `python myfile.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### IDEs\n",
    "\n",
    "An \"IDE\" (integrated development environment) like Spyder, PyCharm, or VsCode:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Helps you **write** your code by providing syntax highlighting, and potentially pointing out errors\n",
    "- Helps you **run** your program, potentially displaying outputs in a helpful way\n",
    "- Helps you **debug** by providing additional, helpful information\n",
    "\n",
    "> Jupyter is a special type of IDE. It lets you run your code piece by piece instead of all at once. It's a bit unique since it requires special `.ipynb` files instead of standard `.py` files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CSVs & Excel 📊\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to `.py` vs. `ipynb`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A `.csv` file is a plain-text data file, where columns are separated by commas. (csv = comma separated values).\n",
    "  - You can open and edit this with a plain-text editor, like notepad (try it!)\n",
    "  - This is nice, simple, \"universal\" data format that's easy to pass around between different programs (excel, Python, wolfram)\n",
    "  \n",
    "- A `.xlsx` file is a specialized data file designed to be opened and interpreted by Excel.\n",
    "  - It doesn't just contain raw data, it also contains formatting information (cell colors, fonts, formatting rules) and formulas.\n",
    "  - Other programs can sometimes open these files correctly but it's more complicated and information may be lost. "

    "## II. Jupyter Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Jupyter?\n",
    "\n",
    "- `.ipynb` files are Python \"jupyter notebook\" files, meant to be edited and run inside a Jupyter Notebook program\n",
    "  - Eg, the classic \"Jupyter Notebook\" or the next-generation \"Jupyter Lab\" interface\n",
    "  - Some IDEs also have built-in jupyter editing programs\n",
    "  - Some places, like github.com, can \"render\" an uploaded notebook for reading, but will not let you run/edit it.\n",
    "- Notebooks are made of **cells**\n",
    "  - `code` cells can be run interactively, and will display outputs inline\n",
    "  - `markdown` cells allow for text annotations\n",
    "- Jupyter typically uses the web browser as the graphics engine / GUI but don't be fooled: _you are not online._\n",
    "  - The browser is simply being used to display locally served files.\n",
    "  - Similarly, you could open a local pdf file in Chrome, leveraging the browsers pdf viewing capabilities on a local file.\n",
    "    - (Although unlike with a pdf file, you also need the Jupyter program to be running to properly open `.ipynb` files)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why it rocks 🎸\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **interactive nature** makes it really powerful for quickly testing out ideas!\n",
    "  - As your code gets more complex you may move or \"refactor\" some of all of it into more organized Python `.py` files\n",
    "- The ability to **see \"outputs\" directly/inline** makes it a very powerful tool for data science\n",
    "  - In particular, pandas DataFrames and many data visualizations render nicely in Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "- The ability to add **text annotations** is a powerful way to document, for yourself and others, what you're doing and why.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a \"kernel\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "The usage of \"kernel\" in the iPython/Jupyter world is a bit weird!\n",
    "\n",
    "> [Definition](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/projects/kernels.html): \"Kernels are programming language specific processes that run independently and interact with the Jupyter Applications and their user interfaces.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Two key points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You can install additional \"kernels\" for many languages besides Python, and for different versions of Python. This would allow you to use that language in the Jupyter interface.\n",
    "2. When you \"restart a kernel\" you are basically restarting the runtime, clearing all variables saved in memory, allowing you to run cells again from scratch. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Navigating a notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "- `enter` → \"edit\" mode\n",
    "  - `shift + enter` to run the cell\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `esc` → \"command\" mode\n",
    "  - Add/delete cells:\n",
    "    - `a` - add cell above\n",
    "    - `b` - add cell below\n",
    "    - `x` - cut a cell (often used to delete)\n",
    "    - `v` - paste a cut cell\n",
    "  - Change cell type\n",
    "    - `m` - change cell into markdown cell\n",
    "    - `y` - change cell type to code cell\n",
    "  - Other\n",
    "    - `0` + `0` - restart kernel (reset all variables, so you can run from scratch).\n",
